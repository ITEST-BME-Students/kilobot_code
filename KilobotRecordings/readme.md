# Descriptions of videos

## Experiment 01: Base case

These videos show 21 robots organized in a dense cluster. They run the default algorithm.

## Experiment 02 - 04: Varying cycle length

These videos show 21 robots organized in a dense cluster. They run the default algorithm. However, the length of the cycle of each robot varies from cycle to cycle. In other words, in isolation, each robot's flashing rhythm would differ slightly, and the rhythm would change from cycle to cycle. The variation in cycle length increases from batch 02 to 04.

## Experiment 05 - 07: Varying group size
 
 For experiments 05-07, the algorithm used in the base case was restored. The cycle lengths of all robots were fixed to the same value. In these experiments, the group size was gradually reduced.
 
## Experiment 08: Varying group shape

Experiment 08 shows the robots' behavior when laid out in a rectangle.

## Experiment 09: Merging subgroups

This experiment observes what happens when the robots are initially separated into two isolated groups. A piece of board is placed between the groups to ensure they can not communicate. After the groups have synced, they are brought into contact.
